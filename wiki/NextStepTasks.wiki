= Introduction =

Now that the original paper is complete, there are different places to take the library, things to finish, and the like.  This wiki page is here as a gathering place for ideas of what to do with the library.


= Next Steps =

Basic (obvious) next steps:
  * Clean up the code.
  * Submit and investigate bugs.
  * Write API for reading the entire link graph into memory.
  * Re-approach edge cases in parsing.

The completion of these steps will finish the polishing of the original project.  Where to take it from here?  [http://code.google.com/p/wikipedia-map-reduce/wiki/ProjectGoals ProjectGoals] discusses this larger design question.
